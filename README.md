# Liver Disease Prediction
Due to the sedentary way of life, lifestyle diseases are becoming frequent. Various unknown conditions have come 
into existence, and the need for their practical and early detection has become crucial. Traditional methods 
involving physical examination and lab results make it difficult to diagnose. Thus, the application of machine 
learning models comes to aid by facilitating the early diagnosis of liver disease by recognizing critical factors that 
lead to liver damage. The current work analyzes various machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, 
Random Forest, Genetic Algorithm, Support Vector Machine, MLP neural network, Linear discriminant analysis, 
PSO-SVM model, paired with specific Boosting algorithms like CatBoost, XGBoost, Gradient Boost, and LGBM 
Classifier. The attributes like age, direct bilirubin, gender, total bilirubin, sgpt, Alkphos, albumin, globulin ratio, 
etc., of the liver patient dataset, have been used to predict the liver diseases risk level. Different visualization 
techniques were utilized to conclude the data provided, and pre-processing performed using other methods. It 
highlights the accuracies of these models found on the datasets provided.
